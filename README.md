# Transform structure to function
Inspired by recent applications of deep neural networks to the brain structure-function relationship, we apply the transformer deep learning architecture to fit functional connectivities between brain regions from the entirity of the network structure. Preprocessed data is accessed from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset. Processed data, i.e. the structural and functional connectivity matrices, are provided in `hcp.mat`.

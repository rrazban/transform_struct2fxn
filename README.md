# Transform structure to function
Inspired by recent applications of deep neural networks to the brain structure-function relationship, we apply the transformer deep learning architecture to fit functional connectivities between brain regions from the entirity of the network structure. Preprocessed data is accessed from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset. Processed data, i.e. the structural and functional connectivity matrices, are provided in `hcp.mat`.

Training weights of fitted model are unable to be uploaded because they exceed the 2 GB file limit. Predicted functional connectivities from the training splits can be found in `predFC/`.
